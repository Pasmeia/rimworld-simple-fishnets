# rimworld-simple-fishnets
Simple mod which adds 6 fishnets for all vanilla bodytypes (adult only).

* Craftable (included support for large tailoring station from VFE Production)
* Using material color (it doesn't really make sence for all of them to be black)
* Can be worn by nudists without mood penalty
* Recipes require complex clothing to be researched
* Textures are 512*512, dds included

As this is my first mod i may have failed miserably somewhere, though nothing game-breaking happened while testing.
